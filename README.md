# IXF.JS

[![Published on webcomponents.org](https://img.shields.io/badge/webcomponents.org-published-blue.svg)](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/ixf)

IXF.JS is a [Web Component](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction), specifically a [Customized Built-in Element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/custom-elements.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example), which extends an IFrame to bypass the [`X-Frame-Options: deny/sameorigin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options) response header. Normally such headers prevent embedding a web page in an `<iframe>` element, but IXF.JS is using a CORS proxy to allow this.

## Usage

1. (Optional) Include the [Custom Elements with Built-in Extends polyfill](https://github.com/ungap/custom-elements-builtin) for Safari:

		<script src="https://unpkg.com/@ungap/custom-elements-builtin"></script>

2. Include the IXF.JS module:

		<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/ixf"></script>

3. Insert the IXF.JS Custom Element:

		<iframe is="ixf" src="https://example.org/"></iframe>

## Demo

See the [Hacker News using ixf](https://caksup.github.io/ixf/). Supported are current versions of Chrome and Firefox browsers. Edge and Safari do not support Customized Built-in Elements yet.
